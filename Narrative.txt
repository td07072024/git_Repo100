God is angered when Saul, Israel's king, unlawfully offers a sacrifice[29] and later disobeys a divine command both to kill all of the Amalekites and to destroy their confiscated property.[30] Consequently, God sends the prophet Samuel to anoint a shepherd, David, the youngest son of Jesse of Bethlehem, to be king instead.[31]

After God sends an evil spirit to torment Saul, his servants recommend that he send for a man skilled in playing the lyre. A servant proposes David, whom the servant describes as "skillful in playing, a man of valor, a warrior, prudent in speech, and a man of good presence; and the Lord is with him." David enters Saul's service as one of the royal armour-bearers and plays the lyre to soothe the king.[32]

War comes between Israel and the Philistines, and the giant Goliath challenges the Israelites to send out a champion to face him in single combat.[33] David, sent by his father to bring provisions to his brothers serving in Saul's army, declares that he can defeat Goliath.[34] Refusing the king's offer of the royal armour,[35] he kills Goliath with his sling.[36] Saul inquires the name of the young hero's father.
